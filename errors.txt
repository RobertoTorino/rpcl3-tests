How to use:

Place this right after your Ahk2Exe call (and after UPX if you want to move the compressed version).
Now your artifact upload step (e.g., files: rpcl3pc.exe) will see the EXE at the repo root.
Example (YAML snippet with inline PowerShell):

yaml
- name: Move EXE to repo root
  shell: pwsh
  run: |
    $pwdNow = $PWD
    $repoRoot = Resolve-Path "$PWD\..\.."
    $compiledExe = Join-Path $pwdNow "rpcl3pc.exe"
    $finalExe    = Join-Path $repoRoot "rpcl3pc.exe"

    if (Test-Path $compiledExe) {
      Move-Item $compiledExe $finalExe -Force
      Write-Host ":: Moved EXE to $finalExe"
    } else {
      Write-Error "Could not find built EXE at $compiledExe"
      exit 1
    }
You can also use this logic inside your primary build step at the end, if you wish.
