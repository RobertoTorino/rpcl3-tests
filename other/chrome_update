Absolutely! You can use AutoHotkey (AHK) to script the following behavior:

Close Chrome if it’s running.
Force a Chrome update using GoogleUpdate.exe.
Reopen Chrome.
Below is an example AHK script to do this.
Please make sure to adjust the Chrome paths if you installed Chrome somewhere non-standard.

ahk
; Closes Google Chrome if running
Process, Close, chrome.exe

; Optional: Wait a few seconds to ensure Chrome is closed
Sleep, 3000

; Force Chrome update
RunWait, "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Update\GoogleUpdate.exe" /ua /installsource scheduler

; Optional: Wait for update process to finish
Sleep, 2000

; Reopen Chrome
Run, "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"
Save this as UpdateAndRestartChrome.ahk and run it with AutoHotkey.

How it Works:
Process, Close, chrome.exe — closes all Chrome windows and processes.
RunWait — starts the updater and waits until it finishes.
The last Run reopens Chrome.
Tip: If you want Chrome to reopen with the same tabs, ensure Chrome’s settings are “Continue where you left off” (in chrome://settings/onStartup).

This is a generic automation suggestion based on public knowledge about AHK, Chrome, and Windows. For production or managed environments, check with IT before scripting updates! If you want to tweak the behavior, just ask.

You
and can I automate this?

Yes, you can fully automate this process so it runs on a schedule without you having to start it manually.

Here’s how to do it:

Step 1: Save Your AHK Script
Copy the example script (from the previous answer) into a file, e.g. UpdateAndRestartChrome.ahk.
Step 2: Compile the Script (Optional, but Recommended)
Right-click your .ahk file and choose Compile Script.
This creates an .exe file, e.g., UpdateAndRestartChrome.exe, which can be run by the Windows Task Scheduler even if AutoHotkey isn’t installed for all users.
Step 3: Schedule the Script with Windows Task Scheduler
Open Task Scheduler (Start Menu → search "Task Scheduler").
Click Create Task (not "Basic Task" for more options).
General Tab:
Give your task a name like “Auto-Update Chrome.”
Triggers Tab:
Click New…
Set how often and when you want the script to run (e.g., daily at 10:00).
Actions Tab:
Click New…
Action: Start a program
Browse and select your compiled .exe (or, if using the .ahk file, set Program/script to where AutoHotkey is installed and add the .ahk file as an argument).
Conditions/Settings:
Adjust as preferred (e.g., only run if computer is idle).
Click OK to save.
Your process will now run automatically as scheduled!

Summary for Beginners:
This setup will automatically close Chrome, update it, and reopen it according to the schedule you set—no manual action needed.
