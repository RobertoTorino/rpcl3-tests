Method 1: Add Read-Host or pause at the end of your script
Add this to the very end of your PowerShell script:

powershell
# === LOG SUCCESS ===
"[$timestamp] Built $finalExe with embedded WAVs" | Add-Content "changelog.txt"
Write-Host "Done: $finalExe + $zipName"

# Keep window open
Write-Host "Press any key to continue..."
$null = $Host.UI.RawUI.ReadKey("NoEcho,IncludeKeyDown")
Or simply:

powershell
# Keep window open
Read-Host "Press Enter to exit"
Method 2: Run the script with -NoExit parameter
When running the script from command line or Run dialog:

cmd
powershell -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "your_script.ps1"
Method 3: Create a batch file wrapper
Create a .bat file that calls your PowerShell script:

batch
@echo off
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "your_script.ps1"
pause
Method 4: Right-click and "Run with PowerShell" + script modification
If you're right-clicking the .ps1 file and selecting "Run with PowerShell", add this at the end:

powershell
# Keep window open when run via right-click
if ($Host.Name -eq "ConsoleHost") {
    Write-Host "Script completed. Press any key to exit..."
    $null = $Host.UI.RawUI.ReadKey("NoEcho,IncludeKeyDown")
}
Method 5: Run from an existing PowerShell window
Simply open PowerShell first, navigate to your script directory, then run:

powershell
.\your_script.ps1
Recommended approach for your build script:
Add this at the very end of your script (after the success message):

powershell
# === LOG SUCCESS ===
"[$timestamp] Built $finalExe with embedded WAVs" | Add-Content "changelog.txt"
Write-Host "Done: $finalExe + $zipName" -ForegroundColor Green

# Keep window open for review
Write-Host "`nPress any key to exit..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
$null = $Host.UI.RawUI.ReadKey("NoEcho,IncludeKeyDown")
This way you can see the output and any potential error messages before the window closes.

You're right - those methods don't always work depending on how the script is executed. Here are more reliable solutions:

Method 1: Use cmd /k to keep the window open
Create a batch file that runs your PowerShell script:

batch
@echo off
cmd /k powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "%~dp0your_script.ps1"
Method 2: Add a proper pause at the end
Add this to the very end of your PowerShell script:

powershell
# === LOG SUCCESS ===
"[$timestamp] Built $finalExe with embedded WAVs" | Add-Content "changelog.txt"
Write-Host "Done: $finalExe + $zipName"

# Force keep window open
Write-Host "Build completed. Press any key to exit..."
cmd /c pause >$null
Method 3: Use Start-Sleep with user input
powershell
# === LOG SUCCESS ===
"[$timestamp] Built $finalExe with embedded WAVs" | Add-Content "changelog.txt"
Write-Host "Done: $finalExe + $zipName"

# Keep window open indefinitely until user acts
do {
    Write-Host "Build completed. Type 'exit' to close: " -NoNewline -ForegroundColor Yellow
    $input = Read-Host
} while ($input -ne 'exit')
Method 4: Most Reliable - Run from existing PowerShell window
Open PowerShell manually
Navigate to your script directory: cd "C:\path\to\your\script"
Run: .\your_script.ps1
Method 5: Modify how you launch the script
Instead of double-clicking the .ps1 file, create a .cmd file with:

batch
@echo off
title Building AHK Script
powershell -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "& '%~dp0your_script.ps1'"
Method 6: Add error handling that keeps window open
Wrap your entire script in a try-catch that keeps the window open:

powershell
try {
    # Your entire existing script here
    # === CONFIG ===
    # ... all your existing code ...

    # === LOG SUCCESS ===
    "[$timestamp] Built $finalExe with embedded WAVs" | Add-Content "changelog.txt"
    Write-Host "Done: $finalExe + $zipName" -ForegroundColor Green

} catch {
    Write-Error "Script failed: $_"
    Write-Host "Error details: $($_.Exception.Message)" -ForegroundColor Red
} finally {
    Write-Host "`n=== Script Completed ==="
    Write-Host "Press Ctrl+C to exit or close this window manually" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    # Infinite loop to keep window open
    while ($true) {
        Start-Sleep -Seconds 1
    }
}
The most reliable approach is Method 4 - just run the script from an already open PowerShell window rather than trying to launch it directly. This gives you full control and you can see all output.
